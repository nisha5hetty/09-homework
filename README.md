 Sentiment analysis

## **What the assignment was about:**
The assignment was about comparing different sentiment analysis tool and creating our own.

## **Something I learned in the process:**
I learnt how to train a language model, about the 80/20 train-test split and about the brillianty-named confusion matrix. It was interesting! 

## **Something I found challenging:**
Remembering all of this later seems difficult. I keep having to copy-paste code.
